This input is for [31m"Extra Credit"[0m,
Where you can have strings like [31m"This \" one"[0m,
containing escaped quote characters.

However, [31m"this\\"[0m would still be considered a
string with a starting and ending quote.  Here,
the first backslash says that the second
backslash should be taken literally, so the second
one [31m"isn't"[0m interpreted as an escape for the closing
quote.

The same goes for single quotes.  [34m'this \' quote'[0m is
escapted, but [34m'this\\'[0m one still marks the end of the
string.
