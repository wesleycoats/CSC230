This is just a regular text file, with some
common words, some spelling errors and such.
This word is interesting because we have to
replace it with two smaller words.  We have
the same problem right here.  When I replace
some of these words, I will introduce some
more spelling errors, to make sure the program
spellchecks the words that get inserted via
the replace command.
