For this one, most of the words
are in the default dictionary.
The default dictionary is very
small (about five hundred words),
but it still has the ones that we
use most.  Still, some of these
words will be marked as spelling
errors.  Adding words to the
dictionary as you check spelling
is a way to prevent it from
complaining about the same words
over and over.
