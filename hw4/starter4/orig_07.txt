This is just a regular text file, with some
common words, some speling errors and such.
Thisword is interesting because we have to
replace it with two smaller words.  We have
the same problem righthere.  When I replace
some of these words, I will introduse some
more spelling errrs, to make sure the program
spellchecks the words that get inserted via
the replace command.
