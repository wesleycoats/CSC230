This input is for "Extra Credit",
Where you can have strings like "This \" one",
containing escaped quote characters.

However, "this\\" would still be considered a
string with a starting and ending quote.  Here,
the first backslash says that the second
backslash should be taken literally, so the second
one "isn't" interpreted as an escape for the closing
quote.

The same goes for single quotes.  'this \' quote' is
escapted, but 'this\\' one still marks the end of the
string.
